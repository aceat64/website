# About The Site

This is my personal website, so all opinions are my own. I made it to better document some of the helpful information I've compiled about a wide variety of topics, but also to show off some of the projects I've done that I think are neat.

## Development

Note: Since I use the Insiders version of Material for MkDocs, you will not able to run this locally unless you are also a sponsor of the project.

Requires [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), Python 3.10 or higher and a GitHub personal access token (`$GH_TOKEN`). I recommend using `pyenv` to install Python.

### Configure access to Insiders

```shell
poetry config repositories.github-squidfunk-mkdocs https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
poetry config http-basic.github-squidfunk-mkdocs username $GH_TOKEN
```

### Dev Server

```shell
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

### Build Site

```shell
poetry run mkdocs build
```
