# Recommended Reading

These are some of the books I recommend reading. I prefer buying physical books from indepenant/local book stores and from online retailers/publishers that offer DRM-free ebooks. If you have to ask Amazon before you open a book, you don't own that book, Amazon does.

[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) is great, when you purchase a printed book you get a DRM-free ebook as well. These are always in PDF format but sometimes also in Mobi and ePub too. They also offer "early access" to chapters of books you've pre-ordered.

This list is always growing, and it's nowhere complete, so check back from time to time for more.

## Manga Guides

The "Manga Guide" series is a great way to learn about various topics from databases to physics. You can find them all on [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/catalog/manga). If you are a developer and work with any kind of relational database, I strongly recommend getting [The Manga Guide to Databases](https://nostarch.com/mg_databases.htm), especially if you have never heard of normalization.

## Engineering

- [Engineering in Plain Sight](https://nostarch.com/engineering-plain-sight) by Grady Hillhouse of [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/PracticalEngineeringChannel) on YouTube.

## Sci-Fi

- Literally anything by [qntm](https://qntm.org) (Sam Hughes), and all of it is available online for free.
    - [There Is No Antimemetics Division](https://qntm.org/scp) - Set in the world of the [SCP Foundation wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). It explores the concept of antimemes, ideas with self-censoring properties.
    - [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra) - Magic as science/engineering, think "magic NASA".
    - [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure) - The first thing I ever read from qntm, I have been a fan ever since.
    - [Ed](https://qntm.org/ed) - Hilarious and over the top mad science. Who doesn't like giant robot battles?
