:octicons-calendar-24: November 17, 2010

A while back I became a member of the Dallas Makerspace, which is basically the only [hackerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in the Dallas area. I met a lot of cool people and now I have access to a lot of really cool tools (Makerbot, CNC laser cutter, etc) so hopefully I'll have some new blog posts in the next few months talking about a cool project I'm working on. If you live in the Dallas area or will be here on the 20th, come by our open house, it's going to be fun.

From the [Dallas Makerspace blog](http://www.dallasmakerspace.com/blog/2010/11/open-house/):

> On November 20th, [DMS](http://www.dallasmakerspace.com/wiki/Main_Page) will be hosting an [Open House](http://www.dallasmakerspace.com/wiki/Open_House_2010) for all who want to come and check out just what a Makerspace is all about. There will be food, demonstrations, tours, and a meet and greet with the Dallas Makerspace members. Meet people passionate about a myriad of things from robotics, to wood crafting, to art and photography.
