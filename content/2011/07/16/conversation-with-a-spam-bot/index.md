:octicons-calendar-24: July 16, 2011

Today, while I was working on the [inventory system](https://github.com/aceat64/Dallas-Makerspace-Inventory) for the [Dallas Makerspace](http://dallasmakerspace.org) I received a message from an unknown person via AIM. This is not an unusual event for me since I have had the same AIM screen name for over a decade, so I tend to get messages out of the blue from people I used to know or who I gave my info to and promptly forgot (sorry).  While this wasn't the first spam bot to contact me, it was the first to fool me into thinking it was a real human, at least for a bit. Here's the chat log, with my comments:

> **bluesoftball27**: heya!<br/>
> **me**: Hello, do I know you?<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: hey whatss up? 24/f here u?<br/>
> **me**: Who are you?<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: Im natali. Dont you remember?<br/>
> **me**: I'm sorry, I don't. Did we meet somewhere?<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: oh cool.. have we talked b4?<br/>
> **me**: Not that I recall<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: ah ok sorry. wasnt sure. but anywho whats up?<br/>
> **me**: I'm writing an inventory management program at the moment<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: yeah? im so bored over here i dunno what to do with myself.<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: you wanna watch me on cam? i feel like having some fun :-X<br/>

Here is where I started suspecting that _bluesoftball27_ might be up to something.

> **me**: I'll pass, I'm kind of busy<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: k u gotta make a free login for this site that its linked to so i cant be recorded. k?

Yup, this is definately someone trying to trick me into downloading a virus or giving out my credit card info. However, at this point I had not yet realized the responses were automated.

> **me**: No thanks, I don't need a virus right now.<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: k cool. http\://_[redacted]_/7/natali go there and when it loads click JOlN FREE at the top ok?<br/>
> **me**: Ahhh, I see. These are all preprogrammed responses.

Finally I realized the horrible, awful, truth. Natali was a program, sent back in time to steal my credit card, or something.

> **bluesoftball27**: it does ask for a credit card i think but i know for sure it dosent cost anything<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: its just to make sure that you are over 18.<br/>
> **me**: Empty response<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: when u get signed up then u can come watch me on cam and we can have some fun.<br/>
> **me**: What other responses do you have?<br/>
> **me**: Are they static, or based on my input?<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: if u join me in private or tip me some gold i will do anything u ask me babe<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: i really mean ANYTHlNG. :-X<br/>
> **me**: Anything? But you're not even real<br/>
> **bluesoftball27**: lets talk on the site when u get in babe. my aim is messing up<br/>
> **me**: Your aim is messing up? What is this, 1998?<br/>
> **me**: Hello?
