# About The Site

This is my personal website, so all opinions are my own. I made it to better document some of the helpful information I've compiled about a wide variety of topics, but also to show off some of the projects I've done that I think are neat.

## Highlights

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :octicons-terminal-16:{ .lg .middle } **Guide: Terminal & Shell Setup**

    ***

    My setup using Ghostty, zsh, Oh My Posh and a catppuccin-mocha style theme.

- :material-home-battery:{ .lg .middle } **Project: Battery Backup**

    ***

    After being without power for a week, I built a ~13kwh battery backup system to cover the most important circuits in our house (fridge, network and _some_ HVAC).

    A general overview of my smart home setup, powered by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Who Am I

Hi, I'm Andrew LeCody. I am a maker, nerd, and a bunch of other labels that all boil down to: I like to learn and to build stuff. Professionally I am a Staff DevOps Engineer with experience at every layer, all the way down to hardware since I started my career working in datacenters. Outside of work I'm either learning, making stuff, playing video games, or camping/hiking/offroading. I helped start the [Dallas Makerspace](https://dallasmakerspace.org), serving on the Board of Directors and as President for the first 5 years of the organization.

I believe strongly in the power of collaboration, protection of human rights, and taking care of our environment.
